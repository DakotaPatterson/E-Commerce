  ## Description
  This project is a E-commerce Database that uses mysql and node.js to keep track of a companies products. My motivation was to make an application that allowed users to keep track of their products and categories all in one place. This application allows the user to input all the information about their products and then save them to a database, they are also able to delete and add new products, categories and tags. I have learned that using mysql to store databases and have them avaliable for use when needed is a great way to stay organized and have clean code.
